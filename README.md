# ColonyCorp

Hello, my name is Liam McDonald.

Over the course of the course of the covid-19 pandemic I've worked on a few projects now, and this is the latest. 

ColonyCorp is a game I'm making in Unity in my free time. 
I'm learning a lot about both C# and game design. 

I will theoretically post a link he at some point for people to download the game itself instead of just the assests and stuff.
