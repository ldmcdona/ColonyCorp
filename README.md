# ColonyCorp

Hello, my name is Liam McDonald.

Over the course of the course of the covid-19 pandemic I've worked on a few projects now, and this is the latest. 

ColonyCorp is a game I'm making in Unity in my free time. 
I'm learning a lot about both C# and game design. 

ColonyCorp is currently on Alpha 0.2.2

All playable versions of ColonyCorp are available here:

Current code is in the 'master' branch.
